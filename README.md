This is a work in progres, nothing profecional for now, once I have a nixos base configuration I'm confortable with I will make a proper README file.

# TODO list

- Learn lua to make a working and proper nvim configuration
- clean all my nix config so that there is no more than 3 levels of nesting, etc.
