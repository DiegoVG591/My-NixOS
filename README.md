This is a work in progres, nothing profecional for now, once I have a nixos base configuration I'm confortable with I will make a proper README file.

# TODO list

- Make a LSP server to make a proper LSP config, in moduels, because the current one is a monolith
- clean all my nix config so that there is no more than 3 levels of nesting, etc.
