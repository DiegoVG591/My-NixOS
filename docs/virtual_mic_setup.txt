OBS NOISE-CANCELING VIRTUAL MIC SETUP
============================================================

1. OBS AUDIO SETTINGS:
   - Go to Settings -> Audio -> Advanced.
   - Set 'Monitoring Device' to: "VirtualSpeaker"
     (This sends OBS's processed audio into our virtual pipe).

2. OBS MIXER SETTINGS:
   - Click the three dots (⋮) on your 'Mic/Aux' source.
   - Select 'Advanced Audio Properties'.
   - Set 'Audio Monitoring' for Mic/Aux to: "Monitor and Output".
   - Ensure your 'Noise Suppression' (RNNoise) filter is active.

3. DISCORD SETTINGS:
   - Set 'Input Device' to: "VirtualMic"
   - Disable Discord's internal 'Noise Suppression' so it doesn't 
     interfere with the OBS clean signal.

4. VERIFICATION:
   - Run 'pw-link -io' to see the active routing.
